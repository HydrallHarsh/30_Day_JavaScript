# :star2: 30-Day JavaScript
Add my learnings from a JavaScript course 
Welcome to my 30-day JavaScript challenge! This repository contains my progress and logs for each day of the challenge.

## Note: -
### **Each day's directory will contain detailed logs and information about the problem statement, the thought process and how did you solve it. Also try to have log some reference/notes links on the topic that you learned.**
